# Overview
The aim of this project is to analyse different aspects of E-Commerce Company by doing Exploratory Data Analysis. This is done using python libraries like **NumPy,Pandas,Seaborn and Matplotlib**.
Through this project, I explore the data,clean it, summarize and categorize it and derive statistics like brandRevenue. I also compare the fields and draw boxplots to provide visual analysis.
<br><br> This repository contains two files: 
1. E-Commerce_Data_CSV.csv - This is the dataset
2. E-Commerce_Python_jupyter.ipynb - This is the actual analysis. This file can be opened on github itself to look at the analysis.
